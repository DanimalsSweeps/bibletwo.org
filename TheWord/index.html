<h3> The Third Coming </h3>

<p> He came once to save us all. He came twice to save the blessed. The third coming is for the sinners and the rest. If you are below the kingdom of heaven you are welcome here. </p>
<p> Born to a man much like many of us, a baby who is older than time itself, and more committed to it's passage. Counting down the seconds, this baby will age at twice the speed of those around, much like the eldest daughters we have all known. On such small shoulders lay the weight of the world--a fitting punishment for the child of God. </p>
<p> The baby will come from an unwed father, burdened both by his circumstances and his pregnancy. There will be scant enough food. And money. And time. Like many of us, there is the weight of reality only amplified by the weight of expectation. Some carry their burdens on their shoulders, others in their arms. </p>

<h3> HARK! AN ANGEL AMONG THE LIVING </h3>

<br>
<p> Do not surrender unto him your misdeeds. You are responsible for the actions that take place as you stand, as you watch, as you move. You are responsible for the impressions you leave upon others and the world. You may rest weary at his feet but you cannot stop your forward momentum nor the repercussions you leave in your wake. </p>
<p> Heed his words and your own. </p>
<p> The grace of god finds those who grace themselves. You find redemption through your own words and actions. There is no great redeemer left, only an impressionable child to look after. We are a community, and therefore we must raise the third coming collectively. We provide a future for our child, for ourselves, for our own way forward. </p>
